      p
        | We met at a birthday party in 2015.
        | Ironically, we butted heads at our first encounter in the doorway,
        | yet we were quick to spend the night talking and playing games by each other's side
        | (including playing Guitar Hero till sunrise 🎸☀️).
        | Needless to say, phone numbers were exchanged,
        | and a few texts and calls later, we were off on our first official date!
      p  
        | In fact, we just celebrated our 5 year anniversary!
        | Over the years, we have shared accomplishments and many memories together.
        | Just to name a few, we have both earned a degree (technically in May for Skye 😁),
        | traveled every year to visit family,
        | and adopted two pups and a cat! 🐕🐕🐈
      p
        | On Christmas Eve 2017, AJ proposed back at our home in Woodstock.
        | And Skye said yes! (obviously 😜) 
      p  
        | We are very excited for the new chapter in our story to begin! ❤️
