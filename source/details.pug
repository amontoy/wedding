      h4 A few notes about the pandemic and our wedding. 
      p We love you all but if you are not feeling well or think you might have been exposed then please STAY HOME! Below I have listed some precautions and guidelines we are taking to help keep our guests safe. 
      ul
        li There will be hand sanitizer and masks available to anyone who wants them.
        li Each guest will have their temperature checked upon entering the venue. If a guest fails this check twice they will be asked to leave.
        li Our senior guests and others who need extra precautions will be at the two front tables in the room. We ask that our guests respect their space and stay away from those tables. 
        li All employees at the venue serving food or alcohol will be required to take temperature checks and will be wearing gloves and masks at all times.
      p Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns. See you all soon!
