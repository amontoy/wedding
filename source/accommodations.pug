      h4 Hey everyone!
      p We have a group block set aside at the closest hotel to the venue about 20 minutes away.
      p If we get 30 room nights booked, the hotel will provide 2 shuttle services to and from the venue each way!
      p So no need to pay for an expensive uber (or sober drive home ðŸ˜œ). Stay a while, have some fun and get a free ride back to your bed.
      p I will make an update with the shuttle times as soon as they are set in stone.
