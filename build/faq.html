          <h4>When should I RSVP by?</h4>
          <p>
            In case you missed it on the invitations, make sure to RSVP by June 15th. Even family who we know will be there.</p>
        </div><a id='Q02'></a>
        <div>
          <h4>What should I wear?</h4>
          <p>
            The event is semi-formal, but anything you want to wear we are sure will be ok. The bride requests you refrain from wearing a wedding dress, but if that's really all you have to wear, 
            she prefers that to you just come naked.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4>Are there any colors that guests should avoid wearing?</h4>

          <h4>What time should we be there?</h4>

          <h4>Is there parking available near the ceremony and reception venues?</h4>

            The ceremony will take place outdoors (yes we know it is hot we will try to hurry). After the ceremony, everyone can rush into the air-conditioned reception area 
            and enjoy a refreshing ice cold drink.
